# @polpo-ai/core

Pure business logic, types, schemas, and store interfaces for the [Polpo](https://github.com/lumea-labs/polpo) AI agent orchestration framework.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @polpo-ai/core
```

## Agentic loops

Use `defineProjectLoop` for code-first loop definitions that compile to the same JSON-compatible contract used by the API, CLI, dashboard, and runtime. Project files can live in `.polpo/loops/*.ts`; `polpo deploy` sends the source to the server, which compiles it statically and persists canonical JSON.

```ts
import {
  agentStep,
  bash,
  defineProjectLoop,
  permission,
  requireTool,
  toolStep,
  when,
  otherwise,
} from "@polpo-ai/core/loop-code";

export default defineProjectLoop({
  name: "support-flow",
  hooks: {
    "loop:start": [bash("echo support loop started", { saveAs: "audit.start" })],
  },
  permissions: [
    permission({
      id: "support-tools",
      resource: "tool",
      action: "call",
      effect: "allow",
      match: { tool: ["read", "search_docs"] },
    }),
    permission({
      id: "refund-approval",
      resource: "tool",
      action: "call",
      effect: "approval",
      match: { tool: "issue_refund" },
      message: "Refunds require human approval.",
    }),
  ],
  start: "triage",
  steps: {
    triage: agentStep({
      label: "Triage",
      systemPrompt: "Classify the support request.",
      tools: ["read"],
      next: [when("triage.needsRefund == true", "refund"), otherwise("answer")],
    }),
    answer: agentStep({
      label: "Answer",
      tools: ["read", "search_docs"],
      toolChoice: requireTool("search_docs"),
      next: "end",
    }),
    refund: toolStep({
      label: "Issue refund",
      tool: "issue_refund",
      next: "end",
    }),
  },
});
```

Runtime hosts can persist governance/audit data by wiring `LoopRunStore`:

```ts
import { MemoryLoopRunStore } from "@polpo-ai/core/loop-run-store";

const loopRunStore = new MemoryLoopRunStore();
```

`PipelineExecutor` emits typed `LoopPermissionDeniedError`, `LoopPermissionApprovalRequiredError`, `LoopPolicyDeniedError`, and `LoopApprovalRequiredError`, plus structured trace events such as `permission.result`, `policy.result`, and `approval.required`. Approval errors include a resume continuation: the context bag, remaining steps, and previous node. Hosts can persist that on `LoopRunRecord.resume`, approve the gate, then resume from the checkpoint without rerunning completed steps.

Loop run states distinguish the gate lifecycle from execution:

- `awaiting_approval`: execution is paused at a policy/permission gate.
- `approval_approved`: the gate was approved and the run can be resumed.
- `resuming`: the runtime is executing from the saved checkpoint.
- `completed`: the resumed or original run finished.
