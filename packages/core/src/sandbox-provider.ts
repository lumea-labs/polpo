/**
 * SandboxProvider — the port that opens an isolated execution environment
 * (filesystem + shell) for a single run.
 *
 * A provider is backed by whatever the host chooses: the local machine, a
 * Docker container, a Daytona sandbox, a remote microVM, … The proxy
 * execution model keeps the agent loop in the host process and drives tools
 * through the session's `fs`/`shell`, so a run is portable across backends
 * without touching the loop.
 *
 * Pure port: types only, no runtime dependencies. Adapters live in the host
 * packages (node for local/docker, a dedicated package for daytona, the
 * cloud for proprietary backends).
