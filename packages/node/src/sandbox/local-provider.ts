/**
 * LocalSandboxProvider — runs a session directly on the host machine.

 * The default provider for self-hosted mode: a session is just the real
 * {@link NodeFileSystem} + {@link NodeShell}, with NO lifecycle (the local
 * machine has no meaningful suspend) and NO metering. Under a
 * {@link SandboxLease} this means the lease never suspends and behaves exactly
 * as running the tools directly — i.e. identical to today's local execution.
